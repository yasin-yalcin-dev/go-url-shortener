# Software Architecture

## 1. Overall Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Pattern
- **Layered Architecture**: Modular design with discrete layers
  - Presentation Layer
  - Service Layer
  - Data Access Layer

- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**
  - Inward-directed dependencies
  - Isolation of core business logic from external dependencies

### 1.2 Key Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**
  - Clear and unique responsibilities for each layer
  - High cohesion, low coupling

- **Dependency Injection**
  - Dependencies injected from outside
  - Flexible and testable code structure

- **Single Responsibility Principle**
  - Each component has a single responsibility
  - Simplified code maintenance and extensibility

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Presentation Layer (Handlers)
- Management of HTTP requests
- Request/response lifecycle
- URL shortening and redirection endpoints

#### Core Responsibilities
- Validation of incoming requests
- Calling service layer for business logic
- Generation of HTTP responses

### 2.2 Service Layer
- Implementation of core business logic
- URL validation
- Short ID generation
- Analytics collection

#### Core Responsibilities
- URL format verification
- Shortened URL creation strategies
- Expiration management

### 2.3 Data Access Layer
- Interaction with Redis
- Persistence management
- Caching mechanisms

#### Core Responsibilities
- Storage of shortened URLs
- Recording of analytics data
- Fast data access

## 3. Component Interactions

### 3.1 Request Flow
1. HTTP request received by handler
2. Request validated and parsed
3. Service layer processes business logic
4. Data layer ensures persistence
5. Response generated and sent

### 3.2 Dependency Injection
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy testability
- Flexible configuration

## 4. Technology Stack

### 4.1 Core Technologies
- Programming Language: Go
- Database: Redis
- Web Framework: Chi Router

### 4.2 Supporting Libraries
- Logging: Zap
- Configuration: godotenv
- Validation: govalidator

## 5. Scalability Approaches

### 5.1 Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless design
- Independent service components
- Distributed system support

### 5.2 Performance Improvements
- In-memory caching
- Efficient ID generation
- Minimal external dependencies
